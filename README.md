braid-gen
=========

Generates a 3-strand braid in Maya using Python, and intersects the braid with a sphere in Maya using MEL.

The user can choose to make the braid longer or thicker by changing the `append` and `radius` parameters in `braid-gen.py`. The braid will be appended by a fixed length each time the user wants to make the braid longer.
